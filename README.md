## Monty_Hall_visualization

This programme is a visualization of the well known Monty Hall Problem, using python in a pycharm environment.

### Background
The Monty Hall problem got famous fomr the game show "Let's Make a Deal", that problem were name after the gameshow host Monty Hall.

### The problem
The game includes a player, gamehost and 3 doors, behind only one of the doors a prize-Car and behind the others a Goat.
The player gets to select one of the doors, then the gamehost reveale  one of the other doors which has a goat behind it, now the player has the option to switch his choice to the other door or stick to his original door choice.

### Arguments & Solution
For years mathematician and statisticians fought on this exact problem, is it a wise move to change doors?
The argument for not changing was that from the start the player had 1/3 chance of winning and even afer the reveale nothing changes since the problem is still the original problem.

In time it got proven that assuming is wrong, and the revealing provideds us more information that does change the problem.
In practice the chances that the player was right at the first time is 1/3 and that would be his chance to win if he stayed in that choice, while if he decide to change his choice he'll have a 2/3 chance of winning, this option acctually contain 2 routes for statistical calculation since in the first choice there 2 options of selecting a wrong door then the a door with a goat will be reveal and in changing the player will win (under the assumption that he choose wrong in the first pick). 


### Simulator
 this projects allows us to run a simulation of the problem.
 the simulation has 3 modes:
 1. Manual run -> the user get to play the game and make he's own choices.
 2. PC run -> an automatic run of the game with a concent decition of allways changing the pick.
 3. Statistical -> a multiple run of the game, the user select times for play and then presented with the statistical analysis for all of thous game.
